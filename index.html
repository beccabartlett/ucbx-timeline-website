                            stages of

                        <p>In 1891, Berkeley faculty started teaching courses in history, philosophy,
                            mathematics and English to the
                            public
                            in San Francisco, with great success (over 800 learners in the first fall semester). This
                            initiative
                            came to
                            life as a reaction to calls from the Californian people to make the university’s education
                            offerings
                            more
                            accessible and to fully embrace its mission as a land grant university. Indeed, until today,
                            the
                            University
                            of
                            California is bound “to serve society as a center of higher learning, providing long-term
                            societal
                            benefits
                            through transmitting advanced knowledge, discovering new knowledge, and functioning as an
                            active working
                            repository of organized knowledge”1. For the founders of the university’s Extension, this
                            mission meant
                            providing access to learners of all ages and as a consequence, they pioneered the uniquely
                            American
                            concept
                            of
                            lifelong learning through continuing education. In fact, the name of ‘lifelong learning’ was
                            coined by
                            one
                            of
                            Extension's first deans, Sean J. Richardson.

                            The reason for the creation of the University of California as well as its Extension in the
                            late 19th
                            century,
                            was to accelerate the economic development of California to catch up with the roaring
                            industrialization
                            on
                            the
                            East Coast (Picture 1). However, before Extension was born, the university consisted only of
                            a few posh
                            buildings and a theater on a remote hill, in the vicinity of the sleepy East Bay town of
                            Berkeley
                            (Picture
                            2).
                            Privileged sons and daughters of wealthy families were studying and preparing themselves for
                            high level
                            positions in research, politics, public administration, and business. With the idea to give
                            access to
                            its
                            excellent educational offerings to people of all ages, who would attend a single course at a
                            time, while
                            working, Extension breached the gap of academia and professional world, and created one the
                            most
                            advanced
                            and
                            successful continuing education department in history.</p>

                        <p>The central concept of Extension, as envisioned by it’s first proponents, notably the two UC
                            Presidents,
                            Edward
                            S.
                            Holden and Horace Davis, has always been the accessibility to the courses offered by our
                            instructors.
                            Consequently,
                            Extension courses took place where the learners worked and lived, not on the remote campus
                            in Berkeley.
                            After
                            the
                            immediate success of its first courses, the regents officially adopted an extramural
                            instruction plan
                            that
                            formally
                            established the University Extension on Valentine’s Day, February 14, 1893.

                            The concept of accessibility and the willingness to go towards the learners led Extension to
                            constantly
                            innovate
                            new
                            ways of reaching learners, for example, in 1928 Extension teaches on commuter trains, in
                            1945 Extension
                            taught
                            over
                            26,000 learners via its correspondence courses, in 1994 Extension ventures into online
                            education and in
                            2012
                            Extension
                            creates the UC’s first online course production department BRCO.

                            Today, in part due to the global pandemic, Extension has developed the capacity to reach
                            learners beyond
                            the
                            bay
                            area
                            with live instruction. Learners from anywhere in the world are now able to join our courses
                            and we can
                            help
                            them, to
                            launch or change their careers, to support their families, and share their knowledge and the
                            Berkeley
                            mindset.
