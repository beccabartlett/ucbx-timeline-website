                        <p>By the early 1950s, the model of a typical extension student was someone who already at least
                            had some higher education.
                            About 80% had college experience, 40% had earned a bachelor's degree; and 67% were employed
                            professional, semi
                            professional or managerial occupations. Under the direction of Professor Woods, UC Extension
                            moved successfully in two
                            directions at once: First, it began offering "useful training" unrelated to traditional
                            degree course offerings, and
                            second, it shifted the emphasis of the class program from lower-division to upper-division
                            and graduate work. With
                            appropriate involvement of the faculty, Extension began offering a graduate degree in
                            education in San Diego, and
                            masters' degrees in engineering first at five centers in the south and later in northern
                            California as well. Propelled
                            by the successful collaboration between Extension and the university’s faculty, the number
                            of Extension units grew
                            rapidly: Riverside in 1954; San Diego in 1959; Davis in 1960.</p>

                        <p>The 1960s saw a trend toward decentralization. The UC campuses, and, along with them, the
                            Extension units, were given
                            more autonomy, making it possible to respond more quickly and effectively to local needs. By
                            dividing the state into
                            eight regions, one assigned to each Extension unit, all Californians were considered, even
                            if there wasn't a campus
                            nearby. In 1965, the Extension network grew by two new units, Irvine and Santa Cruz.

                            During the 1960s, Extensions on most of the campuses participated in the Great Society
                            movement with a variety of
                            community development experiments, like the Oakland Project, which brought government
                            agencies and independent citizen
                            action groups together to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. In 1965, the Western
                            Center for Community
                            Education and Development was established at UCLA Extension "to provide continuing
                            assistance to organizations, agencies
                            andgroups engaged in seeking solutions to community problems.” UCLA Extension also had one
                            of the largest Peace Corps
                            trainings in the country.

                            Given that nearly 70% of Extension students were working professionals, Governor Edmund G.
                            Brown initiated action that
                            eliminated Extension's small portion of state funding. By 1968, Extension was completely
                            self-supporting and Extension
                            established certificate programs.

                            Given the increasing demand in the job market for specialization, those seeking employment
                            or advancement needed an
                            efficient way to obtain training. Extension responded by developing certificate
                            programs-planned sequences of courses
                            designed under the guidance of advisory committees of campus faculty and top professionals.
