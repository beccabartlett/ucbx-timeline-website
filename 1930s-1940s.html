                        <p>The Great Depression impacted Extension’s ability to maintain its educational offerings,
                            nevertheless, new structural
                            changes allowed for the creation of new resources for professional career development. While
                            other universities across
                            the country spun out their Extensions to become independent colleges with their own
                            standards, faculty and programs, UC
                            held on to its original design of an integrated Extension. As a consequence, control of the
                            Academic Senate grew and to
                            ensure the continuing ability to deliver university credit bearing courses, while providing
                            professional training,
                            Extension offerings were divided into three categories: degree credit, professional
                            upgrading, and noncredit offerings.</p>

                        <p>During World War II, Extension classes and correspondence courses became an important way for
                            service personnel to
                            continue their education. As part of the war effort, Extension’s Director Professor Baldwin
                            Munger Woods took over the
                            Engineering Science Management Defense Training (ESMDT) Program. By the end of the war,
                            hundreds of thousands of
                            research dollars poured into California, spawning new industries and, once again,
                            dramatically increasing the
                            population. UCLA Extension met the critical need for retraining mandated by Southern
                            California's burgeoning aerospace
                            industry, while UC Berkeley Extension expanded its business and engineering courses across
                            the state. Growth also meant
                            an increased demand for teachers. Extension responded by developing an emergency teacher
                            training program that enabled
                            new teachers to satisfy the state's credential requirements.

                            With the new UC Santa Barbara campus, a new Extension began offering classes in 1944. All
                            the while, important new
                            programs were developed and implemented. Continuing Education of the Bar (CEB), for example,
                            was established in 1947 by
                            the Regents of the University and the State Bar of California. Today it is one of the
                            country's largest continuing
                            education programs for lawyers.
