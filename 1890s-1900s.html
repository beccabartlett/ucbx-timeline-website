            <h1>1891 to 1910</h1>
            <h2>1891 - 1900</h2>
            <p>Following years of calls from the public to open access to Berkeley’s excellent courses and programs,
                University
                Extension came to life in 1891 when three professors crossed the Bay by ferry to offer courses in San
                Francisco in
                history (Prof. Bacon), mathematics (Prof. Stringham) and English literature (Prof. Gayley)2. These long
                awaited
                education opportunities were met with much enthusiasm by the people of San Francisco, more than 800
                people attended the
                first classes.

                However, following the official approval of Extension by the Academic Senate in 1892, a financial crisis
                hit the
                university and in 1893 the faculty was no longer able to provide courses to the public without being
                offered any
                compensation.</p>

            <h2>1901 - 1910</h2>
            <p>In 1902, the Board of Regents made University Extension an autonomous department under the leadership of
                the former
                Cornell history professor Henry Morse Stephens. Stephens was a fervent supporter of the original
                ideology of university
                extension’s: “I am longing to try my hand on a great Extension scheme on the Oxford line - I know I can
                do it and make a
                success of it.” In contrast to the initial ‘free lectures’ model of Gayley and his colleagues, Stephens
                designed and
                organized lectures to meet the needs and interests of adult professionals across the state. This model
                was operating
                largely independently of the Academic Senate, used mainly non-faculty lecturers offering non-credit
                courses, and was
                self-funded through a subscription model. With this extremely agile and student-centric model, he
                created the
                fundamental concept of Continuing Education as we know it today. The success of this model and his own
                energy,
                engagement and popularity, allowed corresExtension to grow exponentially, reaching its peak of 15
                centers around the
                state of California in 1905. However, when Stephens continued his career with other university
                appointments after 1905,
                Extension activities declined until they ultimately ceased in 1910.</p>
