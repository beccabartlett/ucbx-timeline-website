                        <p>In 1912, the university came under intense pressure from the people of southern California to
                            create a new, rival
                            institution. To answer the calls, but without wanting to concede to creating a new
                            university all together, the
                            university’s president, Benjamin Ide Wheeler recruited Ira Woods Howerth from the University
                            of Chicago to create a
                            strong Extension presence in the southern parts of the state. It turned out that Howerth was
                            even more of an idealist
                            than Stephens and openly stated his vision for Extension to serve the people of the state in
                            the ways they wanted and
                            needed to be served, irrespective of University ideals. To achieve this objective, he
                            designed a trailblazing
                            organizational structure and implemented visionary new departments: Beyond the original
                            class instruction, he revived
                            the popular public lectures and added entertainment to them, he created departments for
                            debate and public discussion as
                            well as information and social welfare. To reach even more people, he pioneered
                            correspondence instruction and allocated
                            an entire department to it which served up to 5,500 students in 1917. Extension also began
                            working with other
                            institutions in offering classes to specific audiences whose need for education was
                            particularly telling-for instance,
                            the inmates at San Quentin and Folsom prisons. In 1915, Extension ventured into new forms of
                            education and set up the
                            Department of Visual Instruction to exploit the new motion picture technology for
                            educational purposes. Howerth was an
                            idealistic visionary clearly ahead of his time, and as such the university implemented
                            regulatory bodies that govern
                            Extension until today, including the Academic Senate Committees on Extension (1912) and
                            Courses of Instruction (1913).
                            In 1917 Extension began offering courses in Los Angeles a full two years before the
                            university finally gave in to the
                            calls of the public and in 1917 established its second campus, UCLA. By the time Howerth was
                            let go from the university
                            while serving in World War I in 1918, he had managed to establish Extension as the
                            fundamental institution and model of
                            the higher and continuing education it is today in California and around the world. At the
                            end of the first world war,
                            California experienced an economic boom accompanied by a dramatic increase of population,
                            which meant that suddenly
                            there was a greater need, and more money available, for education to offer its basic
                            academic curriculum, Extension
                            began providing vocational and training courses to thousands of veterans and to others eager
                            to compete in new
                            industrial markets.</p>

                        <p>In the 1920s, Professor Leon Richardson served as Director of Extension and reintroduced the
                            ideals of Liberal Arts
                            education into the educational standards and offerings, and recruited standard faculty
                            again. His humanistic vision for
                            Extension was that of ‘lifelong learning’, a term for which is widely credited, and which
                            made Extension a national
                            model and him a leading figure in Continuing Education. In 1923, in collaboration with the
                            American Federation of Labor,
                            Extension launched the Workers' Education Bureau of America, which offered courses in
                            economics, public speaking, and
                            labor problems and history. Despite the fact that many faculty were reluctant to lecture to
                            ordinary adult learners,
                            notably in mission-driven programs targeted at workers, Extension grew rapidly and by 1924,
                            ranked second in the country
                            in the number of continuing education courses offered by an institution of higher education.
